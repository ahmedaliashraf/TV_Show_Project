# TV_Show_Project
Investigate the social imapct of a TV show by calculating the total number of newborn named similarly characters from the show each year

I personally did the project with name data from year 1990 to 2015 and chose 3 shows, The Big Bang Theory and How I Met Your Mother and 
Game of Thrones, that either ran or still running in that time frame.

Code setup will allow one to do this for year as far back as 1880 (the data is already available under the nationalNameDataByYear folder) 
and any show (However, viewership data for the show will need to be added as .csv file under viewershipData folder). Of course, slight code adjustment in the main function will be necessary.
